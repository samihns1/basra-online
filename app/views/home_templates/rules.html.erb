  <h1>Basra — Game Rules</h1>

  <p>Basra is a fast-paced card-capturing game played with a standard 52-card deck. 
  It supports 2 to 4 players and continues until one player reaches 180 points.</p>

  <h2>Setup</h2>

  <h3>Players</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Basra can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.</li>
    <li>Play proceeds clockwise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dealing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A player is randomly selected to go first. Turn order stays the same for the entire game.</li>
    <li>Deal 4 cards to each player.</li>
    <li>Place 4 cards face-up on the table.</li>
    <li>If any of the table cards are the <strong>7 of Diamonds</strong> or <strong>a Jack</strong>, 
        return them to the deck and replace them.</li>
    <li>When all players run out of cards, deal another 4 cards each until the deck is fully used.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>

  <h3>Turn Order</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The selected starting player plays first.</li>
    <li>Turns rotate clockwise.</li>
    <li>There is no passing. Each player must play exactly one card on their turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Capturing Cards</h3>
  <p>When you play a card onto the table, you may capture cards according to these rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Same Value Capture:</strong> If the table contains a card of the same rank, capture both cards.</li>

    <li><strong>Sum Capture:</strong> If the table contains cards whose total value equals the rank of the played card, 
        capture all cards in that matching combination.</li>

    <li><strong>Both Conditions:</strong> If both the same-rank card and a valid sum combination exist, capture all of them.</li>

    <li><strong>Kings and Queens:</strong> These have no numerical value and can only be captured by 
        another card of the same rank.</li>

    <li><strong>Jacks:</strong> Any Jack captures all cards on the table.</li>

    <li><strong>Seven of Diamonds (7♦):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>If the sum of all table cards equals 7, <em>or</em> if there is exactly one card on the table, 
            the 7♦ captures all cards and counts as a Basra.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, it acts like a Jack and captures all cards, but it does not count as a Basra.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Basra</h2>
  <p>A Basra is worth 10 points. A Basra occurs when:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Clean Sweep With a Non-Jack Card:</strong> You play a card (not a Jack or the 7♦) that captures 
        every card on the table in one move, leaving the table blank.</li>

    <li><strong>Seven of Diamonds Basra:</strong> The 7♦ captures every card and the total table value was 7 
        or there was exactly one card on the table.</li>

    <li><strong>Last Capture:</strong> After the final card is played, the last player to make a capture 
        takes all remaining table cards. (This is not a Basra.)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Scoring</h2>

  <h3>Card Majority</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If a player captures 27 or more cards (majority of cards if playing with more than 2 players), they score 30 points.</li>
    <li>If two players tie at 26 cards each, no points are awarded.</li>
    <li>The 30 points roll over into the next round, making that round worth 60 points if the tie repeats.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Basra Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each Basra is worth 10 points.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The game continues until one player reaches 180 points.</li>
    <li>That player is declared the winner.</li>
  </ul>
